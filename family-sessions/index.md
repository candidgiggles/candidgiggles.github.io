Family Sessions are 60 minute sessions held at the location of your choice where I will capture a mixture of portraits and candid shots of your family together. Throughout the session I will be sure to capture various poses and individual personalities. These sessions are designed for families of up to 6 people, however more people can be included for an additional cost. Prints and products are sold a la carte so that you can order exactly what you need to decorate your home or gift away.

The session fee is $85, which covers the photographer's time and talent, pre session consulting, post editing, portrait presentation, design consulting, order fulfillment. It does not include any prints or digital files. Click here for the full product and print price list.
