Family Sessions are 60 minute sessions held at the location of your choice where I will capture a mixture of portraits and candid shots of your family together. Throughout the session I will be sure to capture various poses and individual personalities. These sessions are designed for families of up to 6 people, however more people can be included for an additional cost. Prints and products are sold a la carte so that you can order exactly what you need to decorate your home or gift away.
