Senior sessions are designed for high school seniors who want to show off their accomplishments with high-quality imagery. I will assist in choosing a location, planning outfits, designing your image displays, and customizing your ordering session. If you need graduation invitations, announcements, or thank you cards, a package can be customized to fit your needs. Ideally this session would take place the summer before the student’s senior year, however it can be scheduled at any time.
