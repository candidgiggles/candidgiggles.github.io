> Kimberly Mitchell, owner of Candid Giggles Photography demonstrated top knotch professionalism during our family photo shoot. I highly recommend Kim to take your family or individual photos!- Kalisha H., Flossmoor, IL

> Our family photoshoot was a success! Kimberly chose the perfect site and made my vision come to life. The service was excellent! I'm looking forward to her capturing our 10th Anniversary Celebration memories.- La'Sheah S., Richton Park, IL 

> Kimberly has been our go-to photographer for many of our family's milestones from birthdays to major holidays and the candid moments in between. Her professionalism and attention to detail combined with the quality of prints and products she offers makes us repeated customers. In a time when storing pictures on our phones has become the norm, it's great to have physical prints and photo books to pass on to our children.- Tiffany G., Flossmoor, IL  

> Kimberly made a special delivery of our final photos yesterday. Tears of joy and happiness were my first reactions when I saw them. It really didn't hit me until viewing the pictures that we hadn't taken a professional family portrait since Leah (10) was first born. Thanks for your patience, professionalism and most of all... for cropping out the CrAzY attitudes resulted from the intense heat during the photo shoot. 
You're the Best! -Lori J., Olympia Fields, IL

> My biggest challenge in the past with portrait sessions has been getting one photo where everyone looks good and not having to pick the best of the worst however, with Kimberly I was pleasantly surprised to get over 23 perfect photos!! What I valued the most about my session besides the great photos was Kimberly's professionalism, flexibility and keen eye for detail. She turned a normally very unpleasant experience into something amazing that the whole family including my husband (he hates pictures) enjoyed!- Takisha B. 

> In the past I have had many challenges with other photographers- getting comfortable, feeling at ease, not having any direction, etc. However during my session with Candid Giggles Photography I appreciated Kimberly's "candid" approach to photography. The motion shots (walking, playing in the grass) took a lot of the pressure away from "posing". She was easy going, relaxed and confident. That made us all feel comfortable taking direction from her. We had full confidence in her ability to create a good shot. -Kirstin S., Chicago, IL

> Looking at photos taken before my son's Senior Prom put a great ending on a wonderful Mother's Day! Thanks Kimberly of Candid Giggles Photography. You continue to surprise me with the best things a mother could ever have...memories of special moments with her kids. You're the best!!!- Lori J., Olympia Fields, IL
