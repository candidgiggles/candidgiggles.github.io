Sit back and enjoy your child's game while I do the hard work of capturing all the action and highlights. At Game Day Sessions I will photograph your child and their team interactions for the duration of the game. The Game Day Package is $150 and includes 10 hi-resolution digial images. Prints and products are sold a la carte so that you can order exactly what you need to decorate your home or gift away. Additional prints and products are sold a la carte at a discount. If your child is an 8th grader or high school senior, I encourage you to invest in a <a href="http://candidgiggles.com/memory-year-book//">Memory Year Book</a>, which could include a Game Day Session.
